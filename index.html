                On one side we see various shapes composed of square blocks steadly descending downwards, endlessly
                stacking upwards. Whenever all gaps are filled in a particular row, all blocks are cleared in said
                row. Note that only the blocks are cleared, and not the attached shape. Eventually, the shapes fall
                at a more rapid pace, but all else remains the same. This continues until the increase in speed 
                seems too much, and less lines are cleared as the blocks eventually fill the screen.
                </p>
                <p class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4">
                On another side there is a world of sharp edges and pleasant colors. It seems be from the perspective
                of some person traveling this world, breaking apart dirt, stone, and trees. Eventually, they place
                new stone onto the ground, and it is clear that they are building. And so this cycle continues, of
                creation and destruction, with different looking blocks. There seems to be a day and night cycle.
                </p>
                <p class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4">
                On yet another side there are loud blasts and rabid gunplay above the shoulder of 
                some armed woman running around. She is wearing an oversized backpack and what
                seems to be a sturdy helmet. Constantly entering buildings, she puts everything in her bag.
                <i>13 remaining </i> says the screen, followed by the sound of gunfire. <i>9 remaining</i>. The
                woman takes a shot in the distance. <i>8 remaining</i>. Sporadic violence continues to unfold
                continues until the woman is suddenly the focus of heavy gunfire and she dies. <i>You placed 6th</i>!

                These each refer to some game, and what might be observed from a <span class="inspect" title="quick, relative to the length of the game"> quick look</span>
                of regular gameplay. Can you guess what each example references? One thing each of these have in common is they
                describe the gameflow of certain popular games. What makes them popular is beyond the scope of this
                random thought, but I believe that they each vary in complexity when it comes to learning their respective gameplay 'basics'.
