            <h3>Background</h3>

            On one side we see various shapes composed of square blocks steadly descending downwards, endlessly
            stacking upwards. Whenever all gaps are filled in a particular row, all blocks are cleared in said
            row. Note that only the blocks are cleared, and not the attached shape.

            On another side, there is a world of sharp edges and pleasant colors. It seems be from the perspective
            of some person traveling this world, breaking apart dirt, stone, and trees. Eventually, they place
            new stone onto the ground, and it is clear that they are building. And so this cycle continues, of
            creation and destruction. 

            On yet another side we hear loud blasts and see rabid gunplay above the shoulder of what appears to be
            some armed woman running through fields. On her back is an oversized backpack and she is wearing what
            seems to be a sturdy helmet. She constantly enters buildings, putting all she can find in her bag.
            <i>13 remaining </i> says the screen, followed by the sound of gunfire... and now <i>9 remaining</i>. As
            the woman takes a shot at man in the distance, the screen says <i>8 remaining</i>.

            Will it update? seems just like browser-sync. Which makes sense, given its history.
