        <em>Random Thought: Satisfying mechanics and gameplay are underscored by an intuitive core.</em>
        

        <!--Provide necessary background-->

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
            On one side we see various shapes composed of square blocks steadly descending downwards, endlessly
            stacking upwards. Whenever all gaps are filled in a particular row, all blocks are cleared in said
            row. Note that only the blocks are cleared, and not the attached shape. Eventually, the shapes fall
            at a more rapid pace, but all else remains the same.
            </p>
            <p>
            On another side, there is a world of sharp edges and pleasant colors. It seems be from the perspective
            of some person traveling this world, breaking apart dirt, stone, and trees. Eventually, they place
            new stone onto the ground, and it is clear that they are building. And so this cycle continues, of
            creation and destruction, with different looking blocks. There seems to be a day and night cycle.
            </p>
            <p>
            On yet another side we hear loud blasts and see rabid gunplay above the shoulder of what appears to be
            some armed woman running through fields. On her back is an oversized backpack and she is wearing what
            seems to be a sturdy helmet. She constantly enters buildings, putting all she can find in her bag.
            <i>13 remaining </i> says the screen, followed by the sound of gunfire... and now <i>9 remaining</i>. As
            the woman takes a shot at man in the distance, the screen says <i>8 remaining</i>. The sporadic violence
            continues until the woman is suddenly the focus of heavy gunfire a screen says <i>You placed 6th</i>!
            </p>
            <p>
            These each refer to some game, and what might be observed from a <i title="quick, relative to the length of the game"> quick look</i>
            of regular gameplay. Can you guess what each example references? One thing each of these have in common is they
            describe the gameflow of certain popular games. What makes them popular is beyond the scope of this
            random thought, but I believe that they each vary in complexity when it comes to learning their respective gameplay 'basics'.

                <h3>A Simple Core</h3>
                <p>
                Difficulty and challenge in games are two seperate concepts. This distinction has already been discussed by numerous videos and 
                articles respectively, and more. 
                </p>

            <!--Expand in week 2-->
                <b>To summarize:</b>
                <ul>
                        <li>Difficulty                
                            <ul>
                                <li>Difficulty</li>
                                <li>Challenge</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Challenge                
                            <ul>
                                <li>Difficulty</li>
                                <li>Challenge</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

            Will it update? seems just like browser-sync. Which makes sense, given its history.
